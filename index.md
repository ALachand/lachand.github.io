My research focuses on new forms of interaction in education due to  the increased availability of devices (computers, tablets, interactive tables, ...) in classrooms. I study models and develop tools mixing Activity Based Computing and Orchestration/Scripting in order to manage distributed learning situations and collaborative learning situations at school, in libraries, at home, in museums, etc.
